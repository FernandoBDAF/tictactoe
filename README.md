# React Tic-tac-toe Game

## Overview

This project is a simple Tic-tac-toe game built using React. It allows two players to play the classic game of Tic-tac-toe, taking turns to mark spaces in a 3x3 grid. The game checks for a winner or a tie after each move, and displays the game status in real time.

## Features

- **Interactive Game Board:** A 3x3 grid where players can click to mark their symbol (X or O).
- **Player Turn Indicator:** Displays which player's turn it is (Player X or Player O).
- **Win Detection:** Automatically detects and announces the winner.
- **Stylish Design:** Custom CSS styling for an engaging user experience.

## Installation

To run the game locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. If you don’t have a local server setup, you can use a simple one, like the `http-server` node package. Install it globally via `npm install -g http-server` if you don’t have it.
4. Run `http-server` in the project directory.
5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to play the game.

## Usage

Simply click on an empty square to make your move. The game will alternate turns between Player X and Player O. After each move, the game checks for a winner or a tie and displays the game status.

## Roadmap of Future Improvements

1. **AI Opponent:** Implement an AI opponent so that a player can play against the computer. The AI could have different difficulty levels, from random moves (easy) to strategic moves based on common Tic-tac-toe winning strategies (hard).

2. **Game History and Replay:** Add the ability to record game history and provide a replay feature. This would allow players to review their game, understand their mistakes, and improve their strategy.

3. **Online Multiplayer:** Develop a real-time online multiplayer feature that lets players compete with friends or random opponents over the internet. This would involve setting up a server to manage game states and player connections.
